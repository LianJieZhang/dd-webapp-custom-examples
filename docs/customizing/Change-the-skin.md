# Change the skin using the Theming capabilities

In this tutorial we'll update the application skin using the Theming capabilities.

I'll be using Visual Studio Code as my editor and will use the lightweight setup using a fake backend with mock data.

> You can find the code of this tutorial [here](../../custom-webapp/gui/src)

## Prerequisites

1. You've completed the [getting started guide](../Getting-started.md)
2. You are familiar with [LESS](http://lesscss.org/)

## Starting the application in debug mode

Before I can start let's install all npm packages by running following command in the terminal:

```bash
cd gui
npm install
```

After installing the packages let's start up the server.

```bash
npm start
```

Any change I'll do inside the `gui` directory is now being picked up by the build. 

## Updating the color scheme

Updating the color scheme can be done by opening up the `colors.less` file which is located inside the `gui/src/theming/` directory.

In here you can find a set of neutral and accent colors defined. Let's change this to.

It's not allowed to remove any of the colors in this list, it's only allowed to change the values of each variable. The  variable names can be considered as an api which allows you to easily upgrade your changes into the next version.

```less
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// This file contains global LESS variables that can be used across the application when specifying colors
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Neutral Colors
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@neutralColor1: #262C39;
@neutralColor2: #353B46;
@neutralColor3: #454B53;
@neutralColor4: #576172;
@neutralColor5: #7D8BAB;
@neutralColor6: #fff;

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Accent Colors
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@accentColor1: black;
@accentColor2: #457CBF;
@accentColor3: #D04D52;
@accentColor4: #FFCF43;
@accentColor5: #F47F42;
@accentColor6: #BB96B4;
```

After applying these changes you can see that the UI colors changed.

## Updating the company logo icon

Updating the icons can be done by opening up the `icons.less` file which is located inside the `gui/src/theming/` directory.

This file consist out of [mixins](http://lesscss.org/features/#mixins-feature). The only thing we are allowed to change are the internals of each mixin. 
It's not possible to rename them or change the input parameters. Same as for the colors the mixin names can be considered as an api for easier upgrades.

To update the company logo seen on the top left of the application we'll change the contents of the `.icon-company-logo()` mixin.

I'm using a png image for this which I copied into a new `images` directory which I've created inside the `theming` directory.

```less
.icon-company-logo() {
    background-image: url("./images/batman-logo.png");
    height: 50px;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
```

## Updating some other icons

We'll also update some icons for the toc and the search bar background image. 
This is also done inside the `icons.less` file.

```less
.icon-breadcrumb-home() {
    .icon-home();
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    filter: grayscale(1);
}

.icon-toc-expand() {
    .icon-plus-16x16-ico();
    filter: grayscale(1);
}

.icon-toc-collapse() {
    .icon-cross-16x16-ico();
    filter: grayscale(1);
}

.icon-toc-leaf() {
    .icon-dot-16x16-ico();
    filter: grayscale(1);
}

.background-search-bar() {
    background-color: @neutralColor5;
}
```

## Updating the application font

Updating the font can be done by opening up the `fonts.less` file which is located inside the `gui/src/theming/` directory.

By default there are 2 different fonts used. A font for the headers and one for anything else.

It's possible to either import a custom font or use a standard font.

In my example I'll change the font for the entire website to Arial.

```less
@import (reference) "colors.less";

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// This file contains global LESS variables that can be used across the application when using fonts
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@fontFamily: "Arial";
@fontHeaderFamily: "Arial";
@fontFamilyPath: "./fonts/Calibri W01 Regular";
@fontHeaderPath: "./fonts/PT Sans";
@fontFamilyFallback: "Comic Sans Ms";
@fontSize: 14px;
@fontColor: @neutralColor1;

.import-header-font() {
}

.import-regular-font() {
}

.header-font(@weight: 400, @size:20px, @height: 24px) {
    font-family: @fontHeaderFamily, @fontFamilyFallback;
    font-style: normal;
    font-weight: @weight;
    font-size: @size;
    line-height: @height;
}
```

Notice that I've also emptied the `.import-header-font()` and `.import-regular-font()` mixins. 
As we're not using a custom font these can be left blank.

## Advanced skinning changes

The things are above can be seen as the more simple cases of doing custom skinning. To fine tune everything we'll need to do some more advanced changes.
We'll handle this inside the [Advanced skin changes using css](./Advanced-skinning.md) topic.
